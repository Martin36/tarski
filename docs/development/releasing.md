# Creating Tarski releases

The release process and upload of packages to `pypi` is semi-automated, and involves creating a pull
request from `devel` to `master`, then merging it and creating a GH release (that will automatically 
trigger the `pypi` upload).
The list of detailed steps is as follows:

1. Make sure you're in the `devel` branch.
2. Update the version number in `src/tarski/version.py`
3. Update the `CHANGELOG.md` file manually to reflect the changes since the last release.
4. Don't forge to commit & push the changes.
5. Create a PR against the `master` branch.
6. Once all workflows have executed successfully, merge the PR. 
7. Create a [new release](https://github.com/aig-upf/tarski/releases/new) in the GH repo,
   with an appropriate tag such as `v0.6.0`. The new release will trigger a GH workflow that will
   automatically upload the package to `pypi`.
