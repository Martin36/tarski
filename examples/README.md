# Tarski Examples

Tarski examples are provided as `Python` "local" executable modules, and thus not need to be installed into some
folder in the user's `PATH`. To run a example the following command should suffice, issued from within the `examples`
directory:

```
$ python3 -m pddl_derived_predicates
```

Note that depending on how `Python` has been installed in your system you may need to replace `python3` by `python`.
